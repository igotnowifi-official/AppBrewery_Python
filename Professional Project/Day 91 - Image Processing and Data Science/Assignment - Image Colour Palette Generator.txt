A website that finds the most common colours in an uploaded image.

One of my favourite websites to go to when I'm designing anything is a colour palette website called Flat UI Colors.

It's a really simple static website that shows a bunch of colours and their HEX codes. I can copy the HEX codes and use it in my CSS or any design software.

On day 76, you learnt about image processing with NumPy. Using this knowledge and your developer skills (that means Googling), build a website where a user can upload an image and you will tell them what are the top 10 most common colours in that image.

This is a good example of this functionality:
