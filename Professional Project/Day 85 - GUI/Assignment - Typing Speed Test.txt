A Tkinter GUI desktop application that tests your typing speed.

Using Tkinter and what you have learnt about building GUI applications with Python, build a desktop app that assesses your typing speed. Give the user some sample text and detect how many words they can type per minute.

The average typing speed [https://www.typing.com/blog/typing-speed/] is 40 words per minute. But with practice, you can speed up to 100 words per minute.



You can try out a web version here:

If you have more time, you can build your typing speed test into a typing trainer, with high scores and more text samples. You can design your program any way you want.
