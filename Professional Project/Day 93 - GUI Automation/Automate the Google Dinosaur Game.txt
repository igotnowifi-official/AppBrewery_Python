Write Python code to play the Google Dinosaur Game.

On Chrome, when you try to access a website and your internet is down, you see a little dinosaur. (Apparently because dinosaurs have short arms and they "can't reach" your website.

On this page, there is a hidden game, if you hit space bar you can play the T-rex run game.


Alternatively you can access the game directly here:

https://elgoog.im/t-rex/

You goal today is to write a Python script to automate the playing of this game. Your program will look at the pixels on the screen to determine when it needs to hit the space bar and play the game automatically.

You can see what it looks like when the game is automated with a bot:
